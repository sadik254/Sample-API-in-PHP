# Sample-API-in-PHP
This is a simple api created in PHP. 
There are mutiple tables in the databases. 
This api is able to register user authenticate them and send them verification otp as well. 
The Login authentication is also enabled. 
#By default the password is stored in plain text which is a bad practice but anyone can change it into any hash. 

#There is listing database where you can list item to sell including images which will be encoded in base64. 

There is two databases for listing one is for temporary which will be approved or deleted by the moderator. For which a dashboard will be added soon in this project.

#There is a simple mail.php file that will work as a mailer. It can be edited and use as mail spoofer as well. Only work on real server environment not on local environment.
